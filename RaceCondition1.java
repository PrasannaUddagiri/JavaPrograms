/*
When main thread executes, inc() on c, 
it owns câ€™s lock. Before finishing this method, the child thread cannot own the lock of c; therefore 
cannot execute dcr(). Similarly, when child thread executes dcr(), it owns the lock of c. During that 
time main thread waits. So, these methods are executed without any form of interleaving. However, 
we have no control whatsoever on the order these methods are executed.
